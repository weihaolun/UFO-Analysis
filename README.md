# UFO Analysis with JavaScript

## I. Overview of Project

### Background

Dana is a data journalist writing about her hometown McMinnville, Oregon. Her hometown is famous for UFO sightings and even has an annual gathering of UFO enthusiasts. For this project, I have been helping her analyzing and scraping a set of data in JavaScript format. We have created an app to deploy JavaScript functions to loop through and filter the data, and then created a HTML file to populate the data table using JavaScript. On the HTML file, we added a filter button to filter data on date. Finally, we also used Bootstrap and CSS stylesheet to customize the visualization.


### Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Besides date, I will also add city, state, country and shape. In addition, I have removed the button and set the form to update automatically when the input of filter changes on the website.
